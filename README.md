## Introduction

This repository aims to demonstrate the intersection of data science with e-commerce and digital marketing. By leveraging data science techniques, we can gain deeper insights into customer behavior, segment customers more effectively, and develop targeted marketing strategies that enhance customer satisfaction and drive sales.

## Customer Segmentation Analysis

### Data Source and Description

The dataset used for this analysis is a sales dataset containing various features such as:
- Order details
- Product information
- Sales figures
- Discounts
- Profits
- Shipping costs
- Customer information

### Data Preprocessing

#### Handling Missing Values and Outliers

- **Missing Values:**
  - Numeric columns with missing values were filled using the mean.
  - Categorical columns with missing values were filled using the mode.
  
- **Outliers:**
  - Outliers were not explicitly handled in this analysis but should be considered in further iterations for more accurate clustering.

#### Feature Selection and Scaling

- **Feature Selection:**
  - The features selected for clustering include: Ship Mode, Product Category, Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit, Shipping Cost, Order Priority, and Segment.

- **Scaling:**
  - Numeric features were scaled using StandardScaler to normalize the data and ensure all features contribute equally to the clustering process.

### Clustering

#### Explanation of K-Means Clustering

K-Means is a partitioning clustering algorithm that aims to divide a set of observations into K clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. It minimizes the within-cluster variance and assigns cluster centers iteratively.

#### Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters

The Elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares against the number of clusters and identifying the "elbow" point where the rate of decrease slows down.

### Analysis and Visualization

#### Characteristics of Each Cluster

- **Cluster 0:** Represents customers with medium sales and profit, preferring standard shipping modes.
- **Cluster 1:** Represents high-value customers with high sales and profit, often choosing premium shipping options.
- **Cluster 2:** Represents cost-sensitive customers with low sales and profit, frequently opting for higher discounts and lower shipping costs.

#### Visualizations

- **Scatter Plot:** Visualizing clusters based on Sales and Profit.
- **Bar Charts:** Distribution of Ship Mode, Product Category, and Order Priority across clusters.

## Insights and Recommendations

### Interpretation of Clusters

- **Cluster 0:**
  - **Characteristics:** Medium sales and profit, prefer standard shipping modes.
  - **Insights:** Average buyers. Can be targeted with standard promotions and regular engagement strategies.

- **Cluster 1:**
  - **Characteristics:** High sales and profit, often choose premium shipping options.
  - **Insights:** High-value customers. Should be prioritized for loyalty programs, exclusive offers, and premium services.

- **Cluster 2:**
  - **Characteristics:** Low sales and profit, frequently opt for higher discounts and lower shipping costs.
  - **Insights:** Price-sensitive customers. Strategies should focus on affordability and value-for-money offerings.

### Business Recommendations

- **Tailored Marketing:** Customize marketing campaigns based on cluster characteristics to maximize effectiveness and ROI.
- **Product Offering:** Adjust product offerings and pricing strategies to meet the needs of each customer segment.
- **Customer Retention:** Implement loyalty programs and personalized services for high-value customers to enhance retention and satisfaction.
- **Promotional Strategies:** Design targeted promotions for price-sensitive customers to drive sales without significantly impacting profit margins.

## Conclusion

Based on the customer segmentation analysis using K-Means clustering, three distinct customer segments were identified. This analysis provides insights into customer behavior and recommendations to tailor marketing strategies and product offerings accordingly.
